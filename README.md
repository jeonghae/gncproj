#This project is to 1) download a Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 2) create a tidy data set as described below, 3) upload the R code for the tidy data set to a link to a Github repository, and 4) upload a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data.

## 1) download a Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
## from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## 2) create a tidy data set as described below,
## 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## using R script called run_analysis.R and save the tidy data set as a txt file (tidy.txt) created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE.

## 3) upload github repository "gncproj"
## 4) upload code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
